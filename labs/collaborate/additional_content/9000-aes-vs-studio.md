# App Engine Studio vs. ServiceNow Studio

:::caution
This part of the lab is for information purposes only. No activity required.
:::

**[App Engine Studio](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=aes-overview.html&version=latest)** is the ideal ServiceNow development environment for no-code and low-code application development for developers of all skill levels. 

Pro-code developers can use App Engine Studio as a starting point for application development and easily transfer their applications to **[ServiceNow Studio](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_ServiceNowStudio.html&version=latest)** when advanced configurations are necessary.

Since development is supported between the two developer environments, low-code and pro-code developers can easily collaborate to deliver custom applications.

All configurations to an application, whether performed in **App Engine Studio** or **ServiceNow Studio**, can be captured in the same private application scope. 

Application artifacts configured in **App Engine Studio** can also be managed in **ServiceNow Studio**.
