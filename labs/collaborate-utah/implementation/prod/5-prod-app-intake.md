## Lessons Learned

In this process, we've learned how to customize the App Engine Studio (AES) App Intake form for a tailored experience. By creating and adding our variables, we can modify the form to ask pertinent questions specific to our organizational requirements. Additionally, we've learned the importance of properly ordering these variables to ensure a smooth intake process.
