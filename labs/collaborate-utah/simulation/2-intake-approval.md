## Lessons Learned

During our journey through the 'Intake - Approval' process, several insightful takeaways emerged, all of which can prove helpful for future reference:

**Role Clarification**

The process shed light on the critical role that Jayne, the App Engine Admin, plays within the system. Her duties, while not labeled 'Platform Administrator' or assigned any 'admin' roles in any environment, are far-reaching. Her approvals initiate a sequence of automated procedures that are crucial for the smooth functioning of the system. This serves as a reminder that all roles, regardless of their titles, have significant responsibilities and impacts.

**Approval Process**

The impact of the approval process on subsequent actions (like triggering an automated email to Sydney) was an essential takeaway. This demonstrates the power of automated workflows in saving time and reducing manual errors.

**Segregation of Duties**

Successfully completing this process without Jayne needing an 'admin' role showcases the 'Segregation of Duties' principle. It illustrates that high-level access (like the 'admin' role) isn't always required to complete significant tasks. This reduces potential security risks and promotes system integrity.
