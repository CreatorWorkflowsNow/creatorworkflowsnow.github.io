## Overview

The **Forms** tab in Table Builder is your canvas for visually creating, configuring, and customizing form views for your **fulfiller** users without the need to navigate between different tools. 

In this exercise, we will focus on creating a new default form unique to the `Telework Case` table.

This form view is the 'back-end' view that will be visible in the Platform to the **fulfillers** working on the Telework Cases. 

The **fulfillers** have asked that the following fields be added to the form:
* Opened by
* Arrangement
* Days per week
* Justification

## Instructions

1. Click the **Forms** button in the center of the page.

   This is the default form view inherited from the `Task` table, which we'll customize for the `Telework Case` table.
