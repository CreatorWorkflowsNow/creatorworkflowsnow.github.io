## Overview

The Workspace Builder empowers users of all skill sets to build a custom workspace in a no-code environment. With this builder, you can quickly create a workspace and configure its layout, lists, and record pages. If you need access to more advanced functionalities and configurations, you can open the workspace in UI Builder from within this builder.

A lot has been pre-configured for us. We'll make a couple of changes to improve it.

Let's help the business users visualize quickly cases by priority.
