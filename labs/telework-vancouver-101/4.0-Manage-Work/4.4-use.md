## Bulk Assignment

Now let's see how to handle an emergency ⚠️.

Our team member _Luke Wilson_ is out sick today. 

We need to reassign his work to another case worker. (_It is hard to do when the work is managed via emails and spreadsheets!_)

5. Let's find all the open cases assigned to Luke Wilson

    1. Click the List icon.
    2. Click on **Open** in the Telework Case section.
    3. Sort cases by **Assigned to** by clicking on the header.
    4. Click the button next to "Luke Wilson".
    5. click "Show Matching".

9. Let's ask some question about our data.
   1. Type the following query: 

   * `telework cases by justification as bar chart`

   2.  Click <span className="button-white">Ask</span>.
   3. Click **Telework Case**.

As you type in a query, Analytics Q&A suggests recent searches, indicators, tables, and columns that match what you have typed so far. Only the tables and columns to which you have access are shown.
