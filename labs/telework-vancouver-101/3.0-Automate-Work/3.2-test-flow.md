## Overview

In this section, we will test the flow we just created and make sure it functions as expected. We need to test with a user who has a manager. Fortunately ServiceNow allows admins to impersonate other authenticated users for testing purposes.

In our use case story, you will assume the role of 'David Loo'. He recently learned his child has a minor sickness and will need to stay home for a few days.

He is excited to use the new digital form on the Employee Center to submit his request instead of walking his paper form around the office.

1. Go to the browser tab that says 'Home - Creator Workshops'.
