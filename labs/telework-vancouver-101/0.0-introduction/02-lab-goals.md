## Today's Goals

In today's lab, you will be granted access to your own temporary ServiceNow instance to use for the duration of the day. 

Our goals for this workshop are to allow you to:

1. Gain valuable experience through hands-on exercises with **App Engine Studio**.


2. Convert a real-world use case with process bottlenecks to a streamline, cross enterprise workflow.


3. Take back to your organization the knowledge of how you can make your world of work better.
