Every organization is faced with the challenge of responding swiftly to the needs of its customers. It's easier said than done as most application development platforms require a steep learning curve before being productive. ServiceNow App Engine Studio takes away the complexity of building apps, so that more people can participate and can focus on solving business problems instead of writing code. This is where **App Engine** comes into play, offering a suite of capabilities to supercharge your development journey.

**App Engine** includes:

* **App Engine Studio (AES):** An application creation environment designed to empower users of all skill levels to harness the full potential of the Now Platform for creating and managing their applications. No prior coding or app development experience is required.

* **App Engine Management Center (AEMC):** An essential tool for ServiceNow Platform Administrators to oversee and manage App Engine Studio (AES) requests, deployments, applications, and collaborative developers in a production instance. AEMC streamlines the entire app development process, from intake to production.
