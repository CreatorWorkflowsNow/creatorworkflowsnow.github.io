## Overview 

Today, you step into the shoes of a ServiceNow Developer, tasked with transforming a critical business process. The best part? You don't need a technical background to succeed. With the power of **App Engine**, you'll see how anyone can master this task without prior application development knowledge.

## Background

Meet Amanda, an employee in the government's Office of Regulatory Affairs. Amanda's team handles various requests and cases, with a specific focus on authorizing and equipping employees for remote work, also known as **Telework Cases**. Currently, employees follow a cumbersome process: they print a PDF form, fill it out by hand, scan it, and then email it to Amanda's team. This manual process is time-consuming.

Once the requests reach Amanda's team, they rely on a shared email inbox and a spreadsheet to manage them. Unfortunately, this disjointed approach leads to inefficiencies and poses security risks, as these cases involve three departments: the employeeâ€™s department, HR, and IT.

## Current tools being leveraged 

* **PDF / Word Form:** A PDF form to fill the details about the request

* **Emails:** They send the request in PDF format via email, receive submissions, and communicate task updates.

* **Spreadsheet:** A shared spreadsheet tracks approvals and tasks across departments, including IT requests for remote access and HR safety and management updates for Telework cases.


## Challenges

This fragmented system results in:

* **Wasted Time:** Amanda's team struggles to coordinate and communicate effectively.
* **Unnecessary Firefighting:** They often find themselves tackling urgent issues to prevent security and safety concerns.
* **Staff Burnout:** The workload focuses on immediate crises, leading to staff burnout.
* **Poor Visibility:** Departments lack clear visibility into the status of their work.

Amanda sought help from the IT department, but their plate is full. However, Amanda has gained access as a Citizen Developer to the organization's ServiceNow development instance.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to step into Amanda's role and create a solution to efficiently manage cross-departmental work. Let's make her world of work better...
