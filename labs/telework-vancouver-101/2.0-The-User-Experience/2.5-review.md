In the Use Case story we are following, Amanda's team wanted to replace the paper form that users have to submit to Telework.

In this exercise, you created a digital form called a **Record Producer** for for users to submit new Telework Case requests.

The Record Producer contains the questions provided by Amanda and her team of **fulfillers** as well as UI Behaviors and input validation. 

* Who is the request for?
* When do you need this?
* What type of Telework are you applying for?
* Number of Days per Week?
* What is the reason for Teleworking?

Finally, the Record Producer can easily be found in the **Employee Center** portal for users to request Telework.
