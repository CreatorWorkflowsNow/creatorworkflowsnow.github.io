Here's a checklist the I.T Department gave her to help guide her through the necessary steps:

Remember, this is a fictitious scenario, but the guidance below is very much like the type of guidance you are likely to receive at your company before building your own app for the first time.

## ðŸ’¡ Prework to Start Your Citizen Developer Journey on ServiceNow

1. **List Your Data:** Start by making a list of the data you'll need to track. For example, think about the categories of work you want to manage.


2. **Seek Help:** If you have any questions or need assistance, reach out to the internal MS Teams group "TransformNow". 


3. **Data Transition:** If you're currently using a spreadsheet to manage your data, make a copy and keep only the data that is essential. See the "Don'ts" section for data that ServiceNow will manage for you.


4. **Record Producer:** Utilize a record producer to create a form quickly and reuse any relevant question sets.


5. **Task Management:** If your case workers need to create and manage tasks related to cases, add the related list "Taskâ†’Parent" to your form. Learn more in the **[documentation](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=add-embedded-lists-form.html&version=latest)**.


6. **Educational Resource:** Take time to complete the NowLearning course **[Introduction to App Engine Studio for Citizen Developers](https://nowlearning.servicenow.com/lxp/en/app-engine/app-enginename?id=learning_course_prev&course_id=9f7c9a16874cb9d8f40fc95d0ebb35f8)**.


## Don'ts
Here are a few things you should avoid doing as you start your Citizen Developer journey:

1. **Hands-Off Data:** You don't need to create or import the following data, as ServiceNow will handle it for you:<br/><br/>
   * Approval tracking data, such as approval status and dates.<br/><br/>
   * Dates related to the case, such as submission dates.<br/>


Amanda has already prepared a list of the key data her team is tracking, and she's excited to get started.
