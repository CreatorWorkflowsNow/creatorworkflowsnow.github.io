Along with the ServiceNow instance URL and credentials, the I.T department sent you an email to start your Citizen Developer Journey on ServiceNow App Engine.

## ðŸ’¡ **Prework to start your Citizen Developer Journey on ServiceNow**

1. Make a list of the data you need to track. Ex: Category of work


2. Reach for help on the channel @transformNow


3. If you're using a spreadsheet today, make a copy and keep only the data required. See the Don'ts section


4. Use the record producer to create a form quickly and reuse any relevant questions set


5. If case workers need to create and see tasks related to the case, add the related list ( "Taskâ†’Parent") to a form ([see documentation](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/utah-platform-administration/page/administer/form-administration/concept/configure-form-layout.html))


6. Read the [**No-Code Citizen Developer Guide for the Now Platform**](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/guides/utah/now-platform/citizen-dev-guide/cd-planning)


## **Don'ts**

1. Don't create and import the following data. ServiceNow will take care of that for you
    - Approvals tracking data such as approval status and dates
    - Dates related to the case. Ex "submission date"


**Amanda made a list of the key data that the team is tracking and is eager to start.**

Next, review the Takeoff Checklist to make sure you have the right files and resources needed to complete the lab.
