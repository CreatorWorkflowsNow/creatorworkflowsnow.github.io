In the Use Case story we are following, Amanda's team wants to replace the paper form that users have to submit to Telework.

In this exercise, we will create a digital form for for users to submit new Telework Case requests from an end user portal. 

:::tip
The form you will create is called a **Record Producer** in ServiceNow terminology.
:::

When a requester user submits the Record Producer form, a new Telework Case should be created and routed to their manager for approval in ServiceNow.
