## Purpose

The process we are replacing requires user who want to Telework to submit a paper form. 

In this exercise, we will create a form for for users to submit new Telework Case requests from an end user portal. The form you will create is called a **Record Producer** in ServiceNow terminology. u

When a requester user submits the Record Producer form a new Telework Case will be created and routed for approval in ServiceNow.
