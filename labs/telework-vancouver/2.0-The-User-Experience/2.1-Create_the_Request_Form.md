If you want to preview your catalog item in the Virtual Agent you will need to activate the plugins_ _ **Glide Virtual Agent** and **Service Management Virtual Agent Topic Blocks**.
Additional setup beyond that is required to get NLU to perform a topic conversation via the Virtual Agent.
Feel free to experiment this after completing the entire lab.

## **Exercise Recap**

In this exercise, we learned how to use App Engine Studio (AES) to easily create customized Catalog Items that users can access in Service Portal and on mobile devices.

Our next exercise will focus on taking the building blocks created to this point and making them actionable to drive automation and process optimization
