## Purpose

ServiceNow offers multiple ways to create a user experience for submitting a form. In this exercise, we will learn one quick way to get users off paper forms and emails.

1. Go to App Home tab, "App home Telework"


2. On the application homepage, locate the **Experience** section and click the **‚®Å Add icon**.
![](../Click_Add_Experience.png)

### This takes us to a selection where we can identify the type of experience we wish to create.

3. **Select** the **Record Producer** option.
![](./user_form/Select_the_Record_Producer_option.png)


:::info
A record producer is a specific type of catalog item that allows end users to create records from the service catalog.
:::

4. This launches the record producer creator.


5. Click on the <span className="aes_button">Begin</span> button
![](./user_form/Record_Producer_Click_Begin.png)


6. Set the following values (üí° double-click, copy & paste into the form).

    | |Field Name                | Field Value
    |-|--------------------------| --------------
    |<span className="large-number">‚ë†</span>|Name              | Apply for Telework
    |<span className="large-number">‚ë°</span>|Short Description | Use this form to apply for Telework
    |<span className="large-number">‚ë¢</span>|Click on the <span className="aes_button">Continue</span> button.

9. Click on **Location** , then under **Catalogs**, click on **Browse**.
![](./user_form/Select_Catalog.png)


10. Click on **Service Catalog** , then click on the right arrow to move the item over to the Selected list.


11. At the bottom, Click on the <span className="aes_button">Save selections</span> button.
![](./user_form/selected_catalog.png)


12. Under **Categories** , **click** on **Browse**.


13. Move **Can We Help You?** to the right-hand side and Click on the <span className="aes_button">Save selections</span> button.

    Your screen should look like below.

    ![](./images/RecordProducer_Location.png)


14. Let's add questions to the form. Click the <span className="aes_button">Continue to Questions</span> button.

:::info
Unlike in a paper-based form, we don't need to ask users to fill personal information like first name, last name, ‚Ä¶, or date of request. That information will be automatically attached to the case. This makes filling forms so much faster.
:::

15. We want to allow users to open a case on behalf of another individual, so let's start by asking users " **Who is this request for?**" and " **When do you need this?"**


16. **Click** on Questions.


17. Click the arrow next to <span className="aes_button">Insert new question</span> then click "Question set".
![](../images/2023-10-04-13-07-15.png)


18. Select "Standard Employee Questions" and click Submit.
![](./user_form/Select_Standard_Employee_Questions.png)

:::tip
This will add two frequently asked questions on forms. Click the little arrow on the left to see the questions.
![](./user_form/Standard_Employee_Questions_Added.png)
:::

19. One key information we need users to provide is the type of arrangement they are applying for.

    1. Click Insert new question.

    2. For Question type, select **Choice**.

    3. For **Question subtype** , select **Record reference**.
    ![](./user_form/Question_subtype_select_Record_reference.png)

    4. Scroll down to the **Details** section.

    5. In the **Details** section, enter the following information: (üí° double-click, copy & paste into the form).

    | |Field Name                   | Field Value
    |-|-----------------------------| --------------
    |1|**Map to a specific field**  | Checked

    ![](./user_form/question_Arrangement.png)
    :::

    6. Click on **Continue to Additional details ‚Üí**.

    7. In the **Additional details** section, set the **Source Table** to the **Arrangement** table we imported earlier as options for this question.
    ![](../images/2023-10-04-13-10-47.png)

    8. Then Click on the **Annotation** tab.
    ![](../images/2023-10-04-13-11-10.png)

    In the current process, the team is spending a lot of time correcting and manually re-routing applications due to people confusing the different types of Telework arrangement. <br/><br/>
    Let's fix that.<br/><br/>
    We'll use the  **Annotation**  tab to provide users with additional instructions for the question.<br/><br/>

    11. Check the box **Show instructions**.

    12. Open the file: **telework form annotation.docx**.

    13. Copy all the text in the file ( ‚åò Cmd  or CTRL+A, CTRL+C )

    14. Paste it into the Annotation section of the Telework Form (‚åò Cmd  or CTRL+V ). You can choose to either keep or remove formatting.

    15. Click on the <span className="aes_button">Insert Question</span> button.
    ![](./user_form/add_Annotation_Complete.png)


20. Back to the main form, Click on the <span className="aes_button">Insert Question</span> button.
![](./user_form/Click_on_Insert_New_Question.png)

    4. Click on **Additional details**.

    ![](./user_form/Question_Number_of_Days_per_Week.png)

    5. In the **Additional details** section, for the **Text validation** field, select **Number**.

    6. Click on the <span className="aes_button">Insert Question</span> button.


22. Back on the **Questions** page, we're going to define the dynamic behavior of the question "Number of Days per week?" based on the answer to the previous question "What type of Telework...?"

    |------------------------------ | --------------
    | Make the question mandatory | Yes

If you want to preview your catalog item in the Virtual Agent you will need to activate the plugins_ _ **Glide Virtual Agent** and **Service Management Virtual Agent Topic Blocks**.
Additional setup beyond that is required to get NLU to perform a topic conversation via the Virtual Agent.
Feel free to experiment this after completing the entire lab.

## **Exercise Recap**

In this exercise, we learned how to use App Engine Studio (AES) to easily create customized Catalog Items that users can access in Service Portal and on mobile devices.

Our next exercise will focus on taking the building blocks created to this point and making them actionable to drive automation and process optimization
