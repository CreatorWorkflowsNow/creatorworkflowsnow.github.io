## Overview

The requirements for the **Record Producer** form is that it should contain the following questions: 

* **Who is the request for?**
  * Auto-populates with the name of the current user, but can be edited to a different user. 
* **When do you need this?**
    * Today
    * Tomorrow
    * This week
    * Next Week
* **What type of Telework are you applying for?**
  *  Regular and Recurring Telework
  *  Remote Telework
  *  Situational Telework 
* **Number of Days per Week?**
  *  Text field, but validate the input is an integer
  *  Should only appear if previous answer is 'Situational Telework'
* **What is the reason for Teleworking?**
  * Dependent Care
  * Medical
  * Reasonable Accommodation

A **Question set** is a ServiceNow term for a set of questions that can be re-used across multiple Record Producers and Catalog Items. Some questions in the set might have special logic to validate input or auto-populate answers.

The first two questions you will add to your **Record Producer** already exist on the system as part of a **Question set**  called 'Standard Employee Questions'. 

* **Who is the request for?**
* **When do you need this?**

:::note
Advanced ServiceNow users may know Questions sets outside of App Engine Studio by a different name 'Variable sets'.

## Exercise Recap

The **Record Producer** form now has the required fields and behavior added to it.  You were able to leverage a 'Question set' so that you did not have to recreate the Standard Employee Questions. 

In the next exercise, you will learn to preview the **Record Producer** form before it is published.
