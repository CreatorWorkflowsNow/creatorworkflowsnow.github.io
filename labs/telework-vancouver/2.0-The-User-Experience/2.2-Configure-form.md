## Overview

Earlier, you created the **back-end** form the **fulfiller** users will see for records on the `Telework Case` table. In this exercise, you will create the **front-end** form with questions for the user to answer when submitting the form. 

The **fulfiller** users have requested that the **Record Producer** ask the **requester** the following questions from the PDF form we are digitizing:

* **Who is the request for?**
  * _Should auto-populate with the name of the current user, but can be edited to a different user._
* **When do you need this?**
    * _Options should be:_
      * Today
      * Tomorrow
      * This week
      * Next Week
* **What type of Telework are you applying for?**
  * _Options should be:_
    *  Regular and Recurring Telework
    *  Remote Telework
    *  Situational Telework 
* **Number of Days per Week?**
  *  _Input should only be an integer. No letters allowed._
  *  _This field should only appear if the answer to the previous question is 'Situational Telework'._
* **What is the reason for Teleworking?**
  * _Options should be:_
    * Dependent Care
    * Medical
    * Reasonable Accommodation

## Instructions

:::info
A **Question set** is a ServiceNow term for a set of questions that can be re-used across multiple Record Producers and Catalog Items. Some questions in the set might have special logic to validate input or auto-populate answers.<br/><br/>
The first two questions you will add to your **Record Producer** already exist on the system as part of a **Question set**  called 'Standard Employee Questions'.<br/><br/>
* **Who is the request for?**
* **When do you need this?**
:::

1. **Add the 'Standard Employee Questions' Question set.**
    1. Click the arrow next to <span className="button-purple">Insert new question</span>.
    2. Click 'Question set'.
