## Overview

On the **Forms** tab in Table Builder, you can visually create, configure, and customize the different form views for your users using the form editor. The views that you define contain the elements that appear when a user opens that form or list.

A form view defines the elements that appear to a user when the user opens a form or list. Each form has a default view, but you may want to create several different form views for different groups of users.

When you created your new table `Telework Case` as an extension of `Task`, it inherited the default form view from `Task`.

In this exercise, you will create a new default form unique to the `Telework Case` table.

## Instructions

1. Click the **Forms** pill in the middle of the page.

This is the default form view inherited from the `Task` table.

It needs to be customized for the `Telework Case` table. 


2. Remove the following fields from the form by clicking the X next to the field.
    - Number
    - Configuration Item
    - Active
    - Parent
    - Description

    When you are done, the top part of the form should look like this:
