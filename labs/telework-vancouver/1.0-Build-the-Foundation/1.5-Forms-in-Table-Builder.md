## Overview

The **Forms** tab in Table Builder is your canvas for visually creating, configuring, and customizing form views for your users without the need to navigate between different tools. In this exercise, we will focus on creating a new default form unique to the `Telework Case` table.

## Instructions

1. Start by clicking the **Forms** tab in the center of the page.
   ![Forms Tab](../images/2023-10-19-13-30-47.png)
   This is the default form view inherited from the `Task` table, which we'll customize for the `Telework Case` table.

    When you are done, the top part of the form should look like this:

    Click <span className="button-purple">Save</span>.


2. Begin by removing unnecessary fields from the form. Click the 'X' next to the following fields: 
   * Number
   * Configuration Item
   * Active
   * Parent
   * Description
   ![Remove Fields](../images/2023-10-19-14-54-23.png)
   * Click <span className="button-purple">Save</span>.
   * After removing these fields, the top part of the form should resemble this:
