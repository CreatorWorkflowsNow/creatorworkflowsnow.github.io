## Overview

On the **Forms** tab in Table Builder, you can visually create, configure, and customize the different form views for your users using the form editor. The views that you define contain the elements that appear when a user opens that form or list.

A form view defines the elements that appear to a user when the user opens a form or list. Each form has a default view, but you may want to create several different form views for different groups of users.

When you created your new table `Telework Case` as an extension of `Task`, it inherited the default form view from `Task`.

In this exercise, you will create a new default form unique to the `Telwork Case` table.

## Instructions

1. Click the **Forms** pill in the middle of the page. 
![](../images/2023-10-19-13-30-47.png)
This is the default form view inherited from the `Task` table. 
![](../images/2023-10-19-14-53-15.png)
It needs to be customized for the `Telework Case` table. 


2. Remove the following fields from the form by clicking the X next to the field.
    - Number
    - Configuration Item
    - Active
    - Parent
    ![](../images/2023-10-19-14-54-23.png)
    When you are done, the top part of the form should look like this:
    ![](../images/2023-10-19-14-55-41.png)


3. **The fulfiller users of the Telework Case Management application want to see who opened the case on the form.**
   1. Hover your cursor above the field 'Assigned to' until the "+Add" button appears and click the button.

**Exercise Recap**

In this exercise, we learned how to modify the list and form views for our Telework Case table.

We also saw some useful things you can do from the list view to generate quick reports.

We were able to complete all these tasks using simple point-and-click administration and without requiring specialized application or database knowledge.

* **Policies and rules**<br/>
Policies and rules define how information appears to users based on role and entries, as well as who can access tables and forms built in Table Builder.

* **Flows**<br/>
You can use the Flow Designer functionality that is integrated within Table Builder to manage your table's record-based flows. You can manage these flows by using the Flows tab.
