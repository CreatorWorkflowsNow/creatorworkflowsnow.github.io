## Overview

ServiceNow has many re-usable data models to help accelerate development. One of the most frequently used is the "Task" table.

## Exercise Recap

In this exercise, you have created a "Telework Case Table" by extending the "Task" table. This table inherits fields from the "Task" table and will be used to track Telework Case Requests. You've successfully completed these tasks using simple point-and-click administration, without requiring specialized application or database knowledge.

**Next, we'll explore list and form views and adjust the layouts.**
