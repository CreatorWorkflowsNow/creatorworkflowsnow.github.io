* _Fields are also known as table columns._

## Exercise Recap

Congratulations, you've built your first table in your application, "Arrangement". 

It contains a list of various Telework Arrangements that can be used later for users to choose from. 

Since it is a stand alone table, it will be easy to add and remove entries to the table in Production so that we can easily update the choices for users to pick from.
