## Overview 

Table Builder is used to design and customize tables, forms, and form elements for users from a single interface without needing to navigate between existing Now Platform tools. 

In this exercise, you will edit the `Telework Case` table using the **Spreadsheet** view in the **Data** tab in **Table Builder**.  

After that, you will switch to the **Fields** view to learn to modify the table properties and structure.

## Instructions
