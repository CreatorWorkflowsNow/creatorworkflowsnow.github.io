**Exercise Recap**

In this exercise, we learned how to modify the list and form views for our Telework Case table.

We also saw some useful things you can do from the list view to generate quick reports.

We were able to complete all these tasks using simple point-and-click administration and without requiring specialized application or database knowledge.


* **Policies and rules**<br/>
Policies and rules define how information appears to users based on role and entries, as well as who can access tables and forms built in Table Builder.

* **Flows**<br/>
You can use the Flow Designer functionality that is integrated within Table Builder to manage your table's record-based flows. You can manage these flows by using the Flows tab.
