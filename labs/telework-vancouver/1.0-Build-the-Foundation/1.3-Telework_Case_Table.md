## Overview

ServiceNow has many re-usabled data models to help accelerate our development. One of the most frequently used is the "Task" table. 

It has many different fields on it for tracking request and ticket type work.  The "Task" table is the basis for many other ServiceNow applications such as ITSM, HR, CSM, and more. 

In this exercise, we will import a sheet the spreadsheet "telework_cases.xlsx" directly into a new Task-extended table. This means our new table will inherit all of the fields from the Task table so that we can use them in our new table. 

Later, we will use this new table to keep track of Telework Case Requests.

## Exercise Recap

In this exercise, you have have imported a spreadsheet into a Data table in your application.

We learned to use the Data Import tool to map the spreadsheet data to new columns in the Telework Case table. 

We were able to complete all these tasks using simple point-and-click administration and without requiring specialized application or database knowledge.

**Next we'll take a look at the list & form views that have been generated for our table and adjust the layouts.**
