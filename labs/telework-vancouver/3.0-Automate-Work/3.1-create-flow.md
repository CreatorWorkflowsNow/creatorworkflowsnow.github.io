## Overview

A Flow is an automated process consisting of a trigger and a sequence of reusable actions. The trigger specifies when to run the flow. The actions perform a sequence of operations on your data.

A Flow can include these components:
* **Trigger**
  * An activity that initiates the flow, such as a record created in a specified table or a scheduled job.
* **Conditions** 
  * Statements that determine when or how an action runs. For example, run an action only if a field is over a certain value.
* **Actions** 
  * Operations executed by the system, such as a field value updated, approval requested, or a value logged.

To understand basic flows, create an approval Flow for new Telework Cases. The Flow will:

* Run when a Telework Case record is created.
* Sends to the 'Opened by' person's manager for approval.
* If approved,
  * Creates a Ticket for IT to configure a remote VPN access token for the person.
  * Sends an email to the 'Opened by' user letting them know their request was approved. 

:::caution
* Your Flow work only exists in your browser until you click the <span className="button-purple">Save</span> button. 
* You are encouraged to click the <span className="button-purple">Save</span> button as frequently as you would like to ensure you don't lose any progress.

:::info
* Did you noticed that the **Approval Field** and **Journal Field** automatically populated?
![](../images/2023-11-03-15-27-11.png)
* This is because these fields already existed on the **Task** table that we extended **Telework Case** from.<br/>
* **REMEMBER:** 
  * If you're tracking any kind of work (tickets, requests, etc.) it's _always_ a good idea to extend from **Task** unless you have a good reason not to.

## Exercise Recap

You've built a Flow that takes care of managing tasks and communications across multiple departments.

Next, you will test the Flow to see it in action.
