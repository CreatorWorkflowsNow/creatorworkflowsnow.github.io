## Overview

A ServiceNow Flow consists of two main parts:

* A Trigger
* A set of automated steps

There are various types of triggers that can make the Flow start such as when a record is created or what time of day it is. 

A Flow can contain many automated steps; however, if you find the Flow getting too long it is useful to move large sets of steps to a Subflow if possible. This allows you to modularize your steps to make the Flow easier to understand and troubleshoot. 

Follow the instructions below to create a Flow that will execute each time a new Telework Case request is submitted. 

## Instructions

1. From the App Home tab, in the "Logic and automation" section, **click Add**.
