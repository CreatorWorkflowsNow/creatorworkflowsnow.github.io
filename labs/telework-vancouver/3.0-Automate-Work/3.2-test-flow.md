## Overview

In this section, we will test the flow we just created and make sure it functions as expected.

We need to test with a user who has a manger. Fortunately ServiceNow allows admins to impersonate other authenticated users for testing purposes.

## Instructions

1. Go to the browser tab that says 'Home - Creator Workshops'.

7. Let's check the execution
    1. Go back to the ServiceNow admin page.
    2. Impersonate David Loo's manager : "Bud Richman".
    3. With email enabled on the instance and a valid email address, the manager would get an email notification and allow the manager to approve or reject.
    4. Let's check if the manager has any approval request in **My Approvals** list.
        1. In the **All** menu, search for and select, type **My Approvals**.

        2. Yes, there is one! Right-click on the **Requested**.
        3. Select **Approve**.

    2. Select  **End Impersonation**.

    4. Click on the **Created** column name to show most recent at the top. We have an email! Click on it to open it.

    5. On the email record, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click on the **Preview Email** related link.

    6. And voila! Observe the email that was sent.
       1. We have automated case updates notifications.
       2. Notice the watermark at the bottom of the email. ServiceNow generates a watermark label at the bottom of each notification email to allow matching incoming email to existing records. This helps track emails sent as part of a case and manage responses to emails.
