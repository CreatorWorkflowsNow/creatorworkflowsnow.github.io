## Lessons Learned

**Simplicity of Collaboration**

The process of requesting collaboration within ServiceNow's App Engine Studio is straightforward and user-friendly, facilitating an efficient collaboration process. The simplicity of inviting someone by name or group minimizes confusion and accelerates the collaboration process.

**Role Assignment**

The ability to assign specific roles, like "Integration Specialist" in this case, during the invitation process allows for clearer task division and expectations. It reinforces the need to understand different roles within a team and their specific responsibilities.
