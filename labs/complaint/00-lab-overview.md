# Enterprise Case Management Experience

## COMING SOON!

## CSM & App Engine

Not every customer problem calls for the same approach to resolution. ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM) is a powerful tool on its own, but when coupled with ServiceNow App Engine it is unstoppable. Many organizations in industries like Government, Finance, Retail, and Resource have specific requirements that are unique to them in how they resolve requests from their clients.  Join this workshop to get some hands-on experience configuring workflows to meet even the most specific needs in fulfilling service requests.

Whether or not you have ServiceNow CSM, or youâ€™re a pro developer, a business analyst, an architect, or a business leader, this low-code hands-on workshop is for you!

In this lab, you will build a purpose built workspace for CSM to prevent critical cases from falling through the cracks. They will configure the OOTB complaints management component of CSM and finally they will use App Engine Studio to configure the complaints process and create a new capabilities to handle complaint investigations.
