# Departmental Services Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create new Departmental Services and how to publish them to the enterprise using Employee Center.

This lab utilizes App Engine Studio to create a custom app on the Now Platform. The application built in this lab can be used to quickly provide structured service management for a group or department. The application provides for service request functionality as well as ways for service consumers to submit issues or questions.

This lab will use the generic term Dept when referring to the group or department that will utilize this app.

**You are encouraged to replace Dept with the name of a group that would be more relevant to your organization.**

Example departments include marketing, badging, mergers and acquisitions, treasury and many others.
