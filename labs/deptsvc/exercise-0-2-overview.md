# Use Case Overview


Departments frequently use email, spreadsheets and manual processes to manage requests for services that they might provide. When consumers of the departmentâ€™s services have questions or run into problems, they frequently utilize ad-hoc communication to engage the department. This lab will focus on these three facets of service delivery.
