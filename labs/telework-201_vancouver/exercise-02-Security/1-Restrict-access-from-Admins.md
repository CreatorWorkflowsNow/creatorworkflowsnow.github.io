    | |Field Name                | Field Value

    |<span className="large-number">‚ûã</span>|First name | Telework

4. Assign the **App Engine Studio Users** role

    :::tip Best practice
    Rather than adding a role individually to each user, assign a role to a group. Group members have all of the roles assigned to a group.
