## Purpose
Requestors have commented that they would like to see the SHIELD Agency's branding in the Service Portal and would like a way to track their Telework Case requests and edit them after submission.

To add branding to the Service Portal, we will be using the Branding Editor to make some simple changes to the look and feel of the application.

We will also modify the "Requests" page to show users all the Telework Case requests that they've submitted or have been assigned to them and add a button that will allow them to navigate to an editable view of the requests in their list.
