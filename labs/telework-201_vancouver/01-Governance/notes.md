== NEXT = Collaboration




Now let‚Äôs join Elsa, one of the App Engine admins in the App Engine Management Center.

Elsa is part of App Engine Admin group, and she receives an new Application request. In AEMC, app engine admins can monitor and govern applications developed through AES. She can approve or reject collaboration, deployment, and application intake requests.


App Engine Management Center on the ServiceNow platform equips you with everything necessary to manage all aspects of low-code app dev. With this all-new App Engine capability, you can control the intake of new applications, streamline developer collaboration, and manage the app deployment process in a manner that is custom tailored to your infrastructure.‚ÄØ 

But before we can deploy the app, our manager asked us to make sure the application is secure. The app might contain sensitive data about employees such as personal address that not even ServiceNow administrators should be able to see.

In this exercise, we will learn techniques for securing our application to specific users and roles.

3.  Assign the **App Engine Studio Users** role

    :::tip Best practice
    Rather than adding a role individually to each user, assign a role to a group. Group members have all of the roles assigned to a group.
    :::

    In the **Telework.Admin** user record, scroll down to the related lists, On the **Groups** tab, click <span className="button-purple">Edit</span> then follow the steps below.

    | Steps                                                 |

    |<span className="large-number">‚ûä</span>| Type **App Engine Studio Users**  |
