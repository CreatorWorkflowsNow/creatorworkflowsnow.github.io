## Use case

In the previous lab, we have played the role of Amanda and built a fully functional Telework Case Management application to help the team efficiently manage work across the IT, HR and employee departments.

Amanda is now ready to release the first version of her application, but before she does, she wants to invite collaborators to help her get started on version two.

The application will contain sensitive employee information so she would like to make sure that regular platform administrators don't have access to the application.

Additionally, the platform admins want to make sure that the custom app developers can't create records on tables outside of their app.

We'll leverage the App Engine governance capabilities to invite collaborators and some platform security features to secure the app and the platform.

Let's get started.
