## Use case

In the previous lab, we played the role of Amanda and built a fully functional Telework Case Management application to help the team efficiently manage work across the IT, HR and employee departments.

Amanda would like to add more features to her application before making it available to users for testing. However, as she is not sure how to implement them herself, it was recommended that she invites skilled collaborators to aid in the development process.

The application will contain sensitive employee information so she would like to make sure that regular platform administrators don't have access to the application.

Additionally, the platform admins want to make sure that the custom app developers can't create records on tables outside of their app.

We'll leverage the App Engine governance capabilities to invite collaborators and some platform security features to secure the app and the platform.

Let's get started.
