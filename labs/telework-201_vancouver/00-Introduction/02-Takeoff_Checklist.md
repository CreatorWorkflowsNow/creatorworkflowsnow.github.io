Welcome to the next phase of our workshop! This session, spanning over two days, builds upon the work you've done previously in creating the Telework Case Management application. Some of you might have developed this application during yesterday's session, while others may have created it in a prior workshop. Regardless of when you built it, we'll start by ensuring everyone has the same foundational application.

## Let's make sure you have everything you need to get started.

Before beginning the lab exercies, you should have the following:

- [ ] A ServiceNow instance URL and credentials.
- [ ] Download the lab files bundle: **[Telework_Lab_Files.zip](../downloads/Telework_Lab_Files.zip)** (Right-click and select 'Save link as...')
- [ ] Extract the `Telework_Lab_Files.zip` file:
    - <img src={iconMacOS} className='inline-icon' alt="iconMacOS" /> <strong>MacOS users:</strong>

       - Right-click on the `Telework_Lab_Files.zip` file.
       - Choose ‚ÄúExtract All‚Äù or ‚ÄúOpen with Archive Utility‚Äù (the exact option may vary depending on your macOS version).
       - The files will be extracted into a folder named `Telework_Lab_Files`.

    - <img src={iconWindows} className='inline-icon'  alt="iconWindows" /> <strong>Windows users:</strong>

        - Right-click on the `Telework_Lab_Files.zip` file.
        - Select ‚ÄúExtract All‚Äù.
        - In the dialog that appears, choose where you want the files to be extracted or use the default location.
        - Click ‚ÄúExtract‚Äù to unpack the files into the specified folder.

After extraction, the `Telework_Lab_Files` folder should contain the following files: 
- Telework_Case_Management_v1.0.2.xml
- people finder.png
- Portal_Background.png
