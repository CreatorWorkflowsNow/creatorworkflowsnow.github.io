Welcome to the next phase of our workshop! This session, spanning over two days, builds upon the work you've done previously in creating the Telework Case Management application. Some of you might have developed this application during yesterday's session, while others may have created it in a prior workshop. Regardless of when you built it, we'll start by ensuring everyone has the same foundational application.

## Let's make sure you have everything you need to get started.

Before beginning the lab exercies, you should have the following:

- [ ] A ServiceNow instance URL and credentials.
- [ ] Create a folder on your machine to store the lab files (ex: AppEngine_Lab): 
- [ ] Download the lab files (right-click, Save link as...then put it in your folder):
    - [ ] File 1: [Telework_Case_Management_v1.0.2.xml](../lab_files/Telework_Case_Management_v1.0.2.xml)
    - [ ] File 2: [people%20finder.png](../lab_files/people%20finder.png)
    - [ ] File 3: [Portal_Background.png](../lab_files/Portal_Background.png)  
    - [ ] File 4: [SHIELD_Logo.png](../lab_files/SHIELD_Logo.png)
