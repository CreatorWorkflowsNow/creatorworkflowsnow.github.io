3. Click **Build from scratch** to create a new workflow.
![](images/automation_Click_Build_From_Scratch.png)

## A Flow is a sequence of actions to automate processes on the Now Platform.

### Logic and automation use computers to manage repeatable processes instead of using people. Logic and automation can reduce human error and speed up processes. App Engine Studio allows creators to add process flows to their applications.

4. Create the flow with the following information:

    |Field | Value |
    |-|-|
    |Name | Main |
    |Description | Manage the Telework flow of work.

    Click on the <span className="aes_button">Continue</span> button.


5. **Click** the **Edit this flow** button to begin the configuration process.

6. You may see a tour popup. Let's skip the tour for now, by clicking the **Skip tour** button.

## The first thing we'll do is set up our trigger to define when this flow will run.

7. Click on **Add a trigger** in the upper left of the flow designer screen.
    ![](images/automation_click_Add_a_Trigger.png)
    ### Flow designer provides different options for triggering a workflow. You can kick off a flow based on a record being created or updated, , run on a scheduled basis, or based on a unique application component like an SLA task being triggered or an inbound email being received by the instance. For our use case we are going to:
    1. Select **Created** from the Record section.
    ![](../images/2023-10-04-15-24-10.png)
    2. Select the **Telework Case** table.
    ![](../images/2023-10-04-15-24-53.png)
    ![](../images/2023-10-04-15-25-15.png)
    3. Click <span className="aes_button">Done</span> to close the trigger.

    ![](images/automation_configure_Trigger.png)

    :::note
    There might be circumstances under which we need to have a particular flow to execute.
    In this case we can use the "Add filters" option to define conditions that must be met for this flow to execute. This helps making flow easier to maintain and reuse.
    For example, we could use a flow specific to new request, one for renewal or request.
    :::
