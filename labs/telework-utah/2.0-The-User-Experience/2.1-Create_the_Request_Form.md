2. On the application homepage, locate the **Experience** section and click the **‚®Å Add icon**.

### This takes us to a selection where we can identify the type of experience we wish to create.

3. **Select** the **Record Producer** option.

:::

4. This launches the record producer creator.


5. Click on the <span className="aes_button">Begin</span> button

14. Let's add questions to the form. Click the <span className="aes_button">Continue to Questions</span> button.

:::info
Unlike in a paper-based form, we don't need to ask users to fill personal information like first name, last name, ‚Ä¶, or date of request. That information will be automatically attached to the case. This makes filling forms so much faster.
:::

15. We want to allow users to open a case on behalf of another individual, so let's start by asking users " **Who is this request for?**" and " **When do you need this?"**


16. **Click** on Questions.


17. **Click the arrow next to** Insert new questionthen click "Question set".
![](./user_form/Click_Insert_new_question.png)

## **Exercise Recap**
