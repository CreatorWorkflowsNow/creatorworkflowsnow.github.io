Amanda works in the Office of Regulatory Affairs where she and her team manage various cases across the agency. Their duties include confirming that employees are authorized for remote work and ensuring they are equipped with the required I.T. tools to handle records and sensitive information securely.

Despite the critical nature of these responsibilities, Amanda’s team lacks a centralized system to track the progress and status of telework cases. Each case involves three departments: the employee’s department, the HR department, and the IT department. The absence of a unified case management system complicates the coordination and monitoring of tasks, leading to potential inefficiencies and security risks.

## Today the team is using:

**PDF / Word Form**
- A PDF form to fill the details about the request

**Emails**
- Email to send the request in PDF format
- Email to receive Submissions
- Communicate task updates

**Spreadsheet**
- Spreadsheet to track approvals & tasks across departments
- IT for Remote Access request
- HR for Safety & Manager
- Manage updates to Telework cases

## Challenges

The lack of a single platform to manage their work results in:

| Wasted Time | Staff Burnout |
| :--- | :--- |
| wasted staff time coordinating and communicating updates.    | Staff Burnout as much of the work focuses on the crisis of the moment instead of planned and leveled workload |
| **Unnecessary Firefighting**   | **Poor Visibility**   |
| Unnecessary Firefighting by the team to avoid security and safety issues | Lack of clear status of the work across departments. |

Amanda and her team have reached out to the IT department for help, but they have no availability to take on new projects. However, they gave Amanda access as a Citizen Developer to the organization's ServiceNow development instance.

Today your mission, and you have accepted it, is to play the role of Amanda and create a solution to efficiently manage cross-departmental work.

Let's make her world of work better…
