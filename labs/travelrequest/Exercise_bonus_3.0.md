## 3.1 Create the Action

Create a custom Ingration Hub Action that will call a real webservice API to update our list of airports.  This will ensure that the locations all remain up to date with some additional data fields for tracking.

## 3.2 Use the Action in a Flow

The Action will now appear as a custom Integration Hub Spoke Action.  You will put it in a scheduled Flow to keep the Airport table information up to date.
