Congratulations on making it so far! 

## 5.1: Putting it all together - Testing our application
We have one last thing to do, which is to test our application. Our person of interest here is Billie Cowley who is wanting to raise a travel request. His direct manager is Krystle Stika, and this relationship has already been inherited through a Microsoft AD integration. We will first directly grant the Travel request user role to one of our employees for the test.

## Optional: 5.2: Activity tracking

Add Activities to the form to see a history of when fields change on the Travel request or comments are added.
