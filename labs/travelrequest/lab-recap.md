# Congratulations, you did it!

**You've successfully built a simple application for employees to raise travel requests and seek manager approval!**

![](images/celebrate.gif)

There are obviously so much more you can do with the application to make it even better

Here are some ideas:


1. Add functionality to capture multiple location travel itineraries


2. Run all requests and approvals via Email / Microsoft Teams / Slack / Virtual Agent etc.


3. [Bonus Exercise 2.1](exercise-bonus-2-1) - Build a travel workspace with playbooks that can monitor requests and also have direct communication with the requestors


4. [Bonus Exercise 2.2](exercise-bonus-2-2) - Build dashboards to track requests


5. [Bonus Exercise 3](exercise-bonus-3-0) - Integrate with APIs to get a list of flights on specific travel dates so you get as accurate a travel estimate as possible.


You get the idea... the list is endless. You are only limited by your imagination on making the experience seamless for every one involved. This is only the beginning.
