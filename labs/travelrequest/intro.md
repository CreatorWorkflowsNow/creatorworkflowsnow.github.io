# Introduction

## Goal

In this session, you will get hands-on experience in creating a Travel Request application using the ServiceNow platform. We will cover concepts such as Building Tables, Record Producers, Integrations and Workflows within App Engine Studio - our low-code application development interface for developers of any level of experience.

After completing these exercises, you will have an application that does the following for your employees:
