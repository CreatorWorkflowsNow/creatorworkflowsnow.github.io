## Bonus Exercise 1: Adding Calculations
Learn how to use Excel like formulas to add cost calculations for a travel request. Our goal here is to use a per diem rate multiplied by number of days, added to the estimated airfare cost to get an estimated trip total cost.

## Bonus Exercise 2: Dashboard Workspace
Learn how to create an interactive workspace for your users to process travel requests. You will also learn how to build a dashboard with custom reports in the workspace.

## Bonus Exercise 3: Integrating via APIs
Use a real webservice API to update our list of airports which we previously imported via an excel spreadsheet. This will ensure that the locations all remain up to date with some additional data fields for tracking.
