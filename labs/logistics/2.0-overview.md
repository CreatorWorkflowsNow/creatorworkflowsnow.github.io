In this exercise, we will learn how to create a fulfiller Workspace experience using the powerful Workspace Builder within App Engine Studio. This will allow the team of fulfillers to easily track and manage their data across the enterprise.

The Workspace Builder empowers users of all skill sets to build a custom workspace in a no-code environment. With this builder, you can quickly create a workspace and configure its layout, lists, and record pages.

If you need access to more advanced functionalities and configurations, you can open the workspace in UI Builder from within this builder.
