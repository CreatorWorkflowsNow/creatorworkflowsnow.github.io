## This use case walks through the creation of a Logistics Management solution.

![](../images/2023-09-11-16-34-46.png)

In this story, you play the role of Joe Shipman. Joe is responsible for managing shipments across the enterprise. Currently, he has no centralized logistics management solution. Joe understands that delays in shipping can lead to serious business issues for the company. Beyond simple user satisfaction or SLA violations, failure to fulfill requests on time can lead to increased cost, risk, and potentially damage the organization’s brand.

As a Citizen Developer, Joe can build applications on the company’s ServiceNow instance. Joe hopes to simplify and automate the shipping and receiving processes to enable near real-time status updates to the business users. This will empower users to make better business decisions to support their organizational goals. Furthermore, because the solution will be built on the Now platform, Joe will be able to seamlessly integrate logistics data with other processes, such as Request Management, already functioning on the Now Platform.
