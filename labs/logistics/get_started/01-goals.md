ServiceNow is committed to empowering our users to provide better experiences while digitally transforming workflows across the enterprise. Two important capabilities we leverage to deliver these outcomes are App Engine Studio and IntegrationHub.

App Engine Studio is helping to fuel the workflow revolution by enabling citizen developers to create impactful business solutions with a no code visual development framework. Powered by simple point and click design, and powerful templates to address common challenges, App Engine Studio helps our users deliver digital solutions substantially faster. It also helps create intuitive and immersive contextual experiences that delight users.

IntegrationHub helps to extend the power of App Engine Studio outside the bounds of IT. Leveraging out-of- the-box spokes, Citizen Developers can easily create powerful transactions that span the enterprise ensuring that systems of record across all departments always have up-to-date and actionable information. This helps us empower users by bringing workflow directly to them and allowing them to interact with processes in their interface of choice.
