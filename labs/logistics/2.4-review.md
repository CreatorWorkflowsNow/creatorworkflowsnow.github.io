In this exercise, we learned how to create a custom workspace using UI Builder. We identified how to group and organize information in ways that benefit our users, as well as correlate information with existing business processes in a single experience.

Our next exercise will focus on taking the building blocks created to this point and making them actionable to drive automation and process optimization.
