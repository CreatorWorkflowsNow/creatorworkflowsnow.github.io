In this section, we will learn how to use App Engine Studio to create a new application which will hold all the functionality we need for our solution. We will also acquaint ourselves with core elements of this lab, and the App Engine Studio interface.

1.	**Login** to your Lab Instance as user **admin**.


2.	Open App Engine Studio by clicking the Open App Engine Studio button near the top of the Lab Page. This will open App Engine Studio in a new tab.


3.	Close the Getting Started popup by clicking the X in the top right corner of the pop-up window.


4.	Begin the process of creating a new app by clicking the Create app button in the top right of the screen.


5.	This brings up the core configuration screen for our new application.


6.	Now, let’s name our application by typing Logistics into the Name field.


7.	Next, type the following description into the Description field: An application for tracking


8.	Click Continue on the next screen that says “Let’s add roles to your new app”.


9.	Click Continue to save your information and move to the next step of the configuration process.
 

Upon clicking Continue, Studio will create the application framework for your new application. Once complete, you will see a confirmation screen.

Congratulations, you’ve just created your first application on the Now Platform!

Now that our framework is complete, we can start building out the data model, business processes, and experiences for our application. Click the Go to app dashboard button.
