In this exercise, we built, implemented, and tested an automation process that leverage data both on and outside our organization. We empowered users to make better decisions while reducing overhead and maximizing process efficiency.

Of course, the examples in this exercise are just the beginning when it comes to the power of leveraging Flow Designer automation and IntegrationHub to delight users. Consider just a few of the possible extensions of this use case. Using these capabilities, you could easily:

•	Proactively notify users automatically of shipping delays.
•	Develop sub-processes for Delivery or Receiving activities tasking employees in a fully managed and traceable integrated solution.
•	Track shipping costs and perform departmental show-back or chargeback calculations.
•	Provide inline help articles and process guides for new team members to walk through the logistics processes.
•	Provide real-time shipment statuses via Virtual Agent chat.

The possibilities are limited only by your imagination as a Creator. If you can dream it, you can workflow it on the Now Platform.
