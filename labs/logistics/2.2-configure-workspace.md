In this section, learn how to adjust the automatically created Workspace configuration. This helps you adapt the experience of an application to the way your users work boosting productivity and user satisfaction with your solution.


## Instructions

1. Click **List** on the left side of page.

### List Categories

Workspace Builder made two **List Categories** for each table based on the **State** field. This is because each field is an extension of the `Task` table where the **State** field lives. 

The **fulfiller users** would like for the **Shipment** List Category to be based on the **Status** field that was added earlier instead.

### In the next steps you will reconfigure the Shipment List Category to use the "Status" field.

2. Click "Open" in the "Shipment" section.
