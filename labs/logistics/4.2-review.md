In this exercise, we learned how to create a new application and map out the data elements important to enable our business process. We learned to use the Table Builder to add and configure columns including Reference fields and Choice lists. 

We were able to complete all these tasks using simple point-and-click administration and without requiring specialized application or database knowledge.
