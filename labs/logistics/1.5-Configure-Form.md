## Overview 

The **Forms** tab in Table Builder is your canvas for visually creating, configuring, and customizing form views for your **fulfiller** users without the need to navigate between different tools. 

In this exercise, we will focus on creating a new default form unique to the `Shipment` table.

This form view is the 'back-end' view that will be visible in the Platform to **fulfiller users** working on `Shipment` records. 

The **fulfiller users** of the **Logistics App** have asked that the following fields be added to the form:

* Destination
* Recipient
* Tracking Number
* Deliver Date
* Carrier
* Status

## Instructions

1. Click the **Forms** button in the center of the page.
   ![Forms Tab](../images/2023-10-19-13-30-47.png)
   This is the default form view inherited from the `Task` table, which we'll customize for the `Shipment` table.

   You can see that the system added the new fields to the form as we created the new columns in the last exercise.
