Imagine the benefits when all types of developers are working together based on their strengths. Business process owners, or citizen developers, can start the application development project to target their exact needs on their time frame. If needed, an IT developer can leverage the initial application and apply their skills with more advanced capabilities, like expanded integrations or a more comprehensive user experience.


## Should you build it?

Before you start planning and building an app remember that just because you can build an app does not mean you should build it. The main purpose of a business application is to solve a business problem or meet an improvement opportunity. 

Most enterprise decision makers do not realize how much of day-to-day business relies upon custom applications, and many of those applications only partially support business needs or user expectations. Build effective applications that increase responsiveness, productivity, and user satisfaction.
