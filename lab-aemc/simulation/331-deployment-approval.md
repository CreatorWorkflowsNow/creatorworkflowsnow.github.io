:::caution
This is a good point to go take a five minute break or stretch. It can take several minutes or more for the app to deploy to the next environment.

6. Eventually, you will see a record appear for your deployment.

If **Has Error** is **false**, then the app deployed successfully to the next environment. 

## ***How can Jayne confirm if the app actually deployed?***

:::caution
As part of the automated setup for your lab instance, Jayne was granted the role ```sn_appclient.app_client_company_installer```.
 
This is a base Platform role that has existed for many years that allows a non-admin user to view apps in My Company Applications.
 
For more information see **[Product Docs: Instance-specific deployment user roles](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=delegated_deployment_user_roles.html&version=latest)**
:::

17. Click **All** >> type 'My Company Applications' >> Click **My Company Applications**.

![relative](/img/lab-aemc/2023-07-11-22-22-05.png)

:::caution
My Company Applications shows you the applications that have been published to your company's App Repo as well as what is installed on your current instance. 
 
For more information see **[Product docs: ServiceNow application repository](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=app-repo.html&version=latest)**
:::

20. Click the **Installed** tab.
*If the app does not appear in the list, then give it a few minutes to refresh.  There is an icon in the top-right that will stop spinning when the page is done loading.*
