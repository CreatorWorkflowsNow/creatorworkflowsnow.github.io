# Telework Case Lab

In this lab, you will get hands-on experience in creating a Telework Case Management application using the ServiceNow platform. 

We will cover concepts such as Building Tables, Record Producers, Importing Data, Custom Workspaces, and Workflows within App Engine Studio - our low-code application development interface for developers of any level of experience.

Help Amanda and the Office of Regulatory Affairs convert a PDF based approval process into a digital workflow.
