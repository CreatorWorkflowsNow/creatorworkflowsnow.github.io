# Exercise 4: Putting it all together - Testing our application

**Duration: 20 minutes**

Congratulations on making it so far! We have one last thing to do, which is to test our application. Our person of interest here is Billie Cowley who is wanting to raise a travel request. His direct manager is Krystle Stika, and this relationship has already inherited through an Microsoft AD integration. We will first directly grant the Travel request user role to one of our employees for the test.

1. Head back into the main ServiceNow interface

1. On the global search, enter **billie.cowley** and click **View results**

    ![relative](images/searchbillie.png)

1. Click **Billie Cowley**

    ![relative](images/selectbillie.png)

1. On Billie's user record, click the **Roles** tab below, then click **Edit**

    ![relative](images/billierecord.png)

    >Also notice on the screenshot above that Billie's manager is Krystle Stika. You won't be able to see this on your screen, but note that this has been preconfigured for you.

1. Under **Collection**, search **x_snc_travel**, you should see the two roles you created for your custom application.

1. Grant the **user** role to Billie by moving it into the **Roles List**

1. Click **Save**

    >This is actually not best practice, but only for the purposes of today's activity. In a real implementation, it would be best to assign a role to a group, and then assign users to that group so they all inherit that role.

1. Click on the profile picture on the top right, and click **Impersonate user**

    ![relative](images/impersonateuser.png)

1. Search and select **Billie Cowley**

1. Click **Impersonate user**

1. Close the pop-up screen

1. Copy the current URL of the page, and open a new Browser tab

1. Paste the URL, and replace everything after **service-now.com** with **/sp**

    > e.g. **if the copied URL is**: https://sad-oct-123-001.lab.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/ui_page.do%3Fsys_id%3De7766625074130102b8affa08c1ed037 <br><br>
    **change it to:**
    https://sad-oct-123-001.lab.service-now.com/sp

# Congratulations, you did it!

You've successfully built a simple application for employees to raise travel requests and seek manager approval!

![relative](images/celebrate.gif)

There are obviously so much more you can do with the application to make it even better, some ideas:

1. Integrate with APIs to get a list of flights on specific travel dates so you get as accurate a travel estimate as possible

1. Add functionality to capture multiple location travel itineraries

1. Run all requests and approvals via Email / Microsoft Teams / Slack / Virtual Agent etc.

1. Build dashboards to track requests

1. Build a travel workspace with playbooks that can monitor requests and also have direct communication with the requestors

You get the idea... the list is endless. You are only limited by your imagination on making the experience seamless for every one involved. This is only the beginning.

ServiceNow makes the world of work, work better for people!
