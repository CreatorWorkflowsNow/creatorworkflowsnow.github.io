# App Engine Governance Lab

In this lab, you will get hands-on experience setting up and managing App Engine Management Center (AEMC) and App Engine Studio (AES).

We will cover concepts such as Pipelines and Deployments, Onboarding Developers, and Collaborations.

Track and manage your App Engine Studio (AES) requests, deployments, applications, and collaborative developers using the App Engine Management Center (AEMC) in your production instance. Additionally, AEMC allows admins to manage app development from intake through production.
