# 6) App Deployment Requests

**Duration: 60 minutes**

In the first section, we will create two tables. Our first table will be used to capture the Travel Requests coming in from employees, and our second table will be used to store all the major airports and cities that can be traveled to. We will assume that all Travel Requests will only be for air travel.
